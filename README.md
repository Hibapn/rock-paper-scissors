### Project Description
This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player competes against an AI, with their hand gestures recognized using computer vision. It uses the cvzone library with a hand tracking module to detect hand gestures and match them against AI-generated moves.



### The Problem statement
Playing games on a screen can sometimes feel disconnected. We wanted to bridge that gap by making an interactive, gesture-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game that adds a more natural, engaging touch to playing with AI.

### The Solution
We created a fun Rock-Paper-Scissors game that uses hand gestures to interact with the game. The player‚Äôs hand gestures (fist, open hand, or peace sign) are detected, and the AI selects a random move. The game tracks scores based on who wins each round!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- OpenCV
- cvzone (for hand detection)
- time (for game timer)
- numpy (for image processing)

For Hardware:
A webcam (for hand gesture detection)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
